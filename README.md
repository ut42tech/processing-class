# Processing Class

## Agent Simulation

### Description

This is a simple agent simulation using Processing. It creates a grid of agents that move randomly around the screen. The agents use Perlin noise to generate smooth random movement, and they wrap around the screen when they reach the edges.

### Usage

To run the simulation, simply open the Processing sketch and click the "Run" button. The agents will begin moving around the screen, and you can see how they interact with each other.
